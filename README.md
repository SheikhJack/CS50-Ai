# 🤖 CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

![CS50AI](asset/CS50AI.png)

Welcome to my personal repository for **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**, a course by Harvard University. This course introduces fundamental concepts in AI, and this repository showcases my solutions, implementations, and insights as I worked through the projects.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Throughout the course, I learned and implemented:

- **Search algorithms** (DFS, BFS, A\*)
- **Knowledge representation** using propositional logic and model checking
- **Uncertainty** with Bayesian networks
- **Optimization** with Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- **Learning** with machine learning models (Naive Bayes, k-NN, etc.)
- **Natural Language Processing** and word embeddings
- **Reinforcement Learning** with Q-learning
- **Neural Networks** with TensorFlow
